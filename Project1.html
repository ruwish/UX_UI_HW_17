          <h1>Design of Travel App</h1>
          <div class="section">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>When I initially joined the bootcamp, our introductory project involved designing a travel app. Being new to this field, I felt a bit overwhelmed. Conversations with my peers revealed a common focus on streamlining flight and accommodation bookings, a logical starting point for trip planning. I followed suit at the time, but a feeling of something missing lingered. As the curriculum progressed, that initial project was momentarily set aside. It wasn't until six months later that I revisited it, and a wave of questions resurfaced. Why had I fixated on the booking process? There's an abundance of apps, websites, and travel agencies dedicated to this task. What unique value could I offer by replicating what was already plentiful in the market?
             <br>With that in mind, I decided to start the project anew. I brainstormed and wrote out new interview questions. This led me to interview five advid travelers, each offering their unique experiences and perspectives. Their insights were able to offer a fresh and enlightening angle for this entire project.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>This project was done solo. To mimic the intensity of the bootcamp, I set the timeline of this project to be a 3-day sprint.
            <br> The objective of this project was to enhance my proficiency in conducting efficient research, since I want my focus to be on UX research. Throughout the project, I primarily utilized tools like Miro, Figma, and FigJam to craft empathy maps, user personas, and feature prioritization matricies.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h3>What I did</h3>
            <p>After conducting my interviews, I sorted out the data onto a Miro board and created an affinity diagram.</p>
            <p>
                It became evident during the interviews that each user had their preferred approach for booking flights and accommodations, be it through Google, booking platforms, travel agencies, or directly with airlines. None of them expressed significant concerns or pain points about the booking process. However, a common theme emerged across all five interviews: organizing the trip comprehensively. This included planning activities, discovering suitable dining places, and identifying places to visit.
            </p>

                As I delved deeper into their methods for choosing destinations, the most common response I got was 'I use Google.' Upon further probing for details, their explanations varied. Some mentioned, 'Google and travel apps provide recommendations for tourist spots, but they lack authenticity.' One user stated, 'I prefer using TikTok to discover locations'.  
            <br>The more intersting insight that I received was from Mati. He is somoene who doesn't use any websites or travel apps when he plans for his trip. Instead, he opts to trust the locals with the information. He apprciated tourist areas, but to him, the real way to experience local life and uncovering hidden gems involed engaging with local bartenders, waiters, and other community members. In his opinoion, this provides deeper insights than any online resources or app could offer.

                With the insight I've obtained from my interviewers, I compiled the information and created an empathy map, which then lead to the creation of two user personas.

                    <strong>User Insight:</strong><br>
                    Lydia, a passionate adventurer with a keen interest in immersing herself in diverse cultures and savoring unique cuisines, is actively seeking a solution to fulfill these aspirations. The authenticity and credibility of online information concern her, and she has found the recommendations she encountered to be inadequate. Moreover, her past negative encounters with customer support on travel apps have added to her apprehensions.

                    Alex, a traveler who highly values learning from the perspective of locals, rarely relies on digital applications during his journeys. He holds the opinion that travel apps and websites often direct travelers to 'tourist traps'.

                    <br>
                    Currently, his primary challenge revolves around effectively engaging with locals, particularly in non-English speaking countries. He seeks a means to comprehend the culture beforehand, aiming to respect unspoken customs and norms during his travels.

                    We believe by integrating AI and machine learning functions into our travel app to tailor for users' needs, people like Lydia will be able to have more personalized options that resonate with her love for new cultures and cuisines.  AI will additionally enable round-the-clock customer support, effectively addressing minor issues swiftly. To further the experience, integration of a potential peer-to-peer design, can connect users to locals who can offer valuable recommendations or even act as tour guides, elevating the overall travel quality.

                    The platforms shown above are direct competitors in the travel app domain. It's essential to highlight that they share a common set of weaknesses identified through user interviews: subpar customer support, authenticity concerns, and an overload of recommendations.
